# Projects



## 1. 

Replicate our fully established Gruntfile.js in gulp. By the end it should:

- Fully lint our JavaScript
- Compile our Sass
- Concatenate and minify both JavaScript and CSS
- Optimize Images
- Run Jasmine against our compiled JavaScript
- Update the version number in both `package.json` and `index.html`.
- Push our updates to git

Since this is a “production deploy” task, gulp should exit on any failure.
